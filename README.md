> Self hosted image placeholders

### Why?
- Images in the online solutions suck **+** it took me less time to build and host this than the time it would take to search in Google

### Tips
- If you need to load multiple images on the same page you can append a query string to the url, to force the browser to fetch a new image. e.g 
  ```
  <img src="https://voltspiksel.herokuapp.com?q=0.905240831687109" />
  <img src="https://voltspiksel.herokuapp.com?q=0.554155228443775" />
  ```
